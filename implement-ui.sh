echo "=== EasyKey UI Implementation Guide ==="

echo "Follow these steps to implement the UI:"

echo "1. First, install the basic dependencies and create a minimal working UI:"
echo "   ./install-ui-deps.sh"
echo ""

echo "2. Test that the minimal UI works:"
echo "   cd packages/desktop && yarn electron:start"
echo ""

echo "3. After verifying the minimal UI works, install the full UI dependencies:"
echo "   cd packages/desktop && yarn add react-feather"
echo ""

echo "4. Then implement the full UI in src/App.js"
echo "   The full implementation includes:"
echo "   - Light/dark theme toggle"
echo "   - Password generator with options"
echo "   - Copy to clipboard functionality"
echo "   - Creative mode placeholder"
echo ""

echo "5. Build the complete application:"
echo "   cd packages/desktop && yarn electron:build"
echo ""

echo "If you encounter issues, try the following:"
echo "- Delete node_modules and reinstall: rm -rf packages/desktop/node_modules && yarn install"
echo "- Try the simplified build script: ./simple-build.sh"
echo "- Run the direct force-render.html version: ./final-build.sh"
echo ""

echo "The most reliable approach is to use force-render.html without React for production builds,"
echo "and use React for development builds."
